            <h2 id="macro-environment">1. Analyze the most important Macro-environment factors that can have an impact on the product in Egypt? Explain?</h2>
            <p><strong>Economic:</strong> Egypt's economic (in)stability, currency devaluation, and fluctuating consumer spending patterns affect the affordability and demand for premium hair care products like Pantene Expert.</p>
            <p><strong>Cultural:</strong> Cultural preferences, beauty standards, and societal perceptions of aging and hair care influence consumer behavior. In Egypt, there may be a growing trend towards embracing aging gracefully and investing in personal care. Remarkably, on the other hand, the boycotting campaigns in Egypt against the pro-Zionist brands are a major factor that impacts consumer behavior, and in turn, affects the launch of Pantene Expert.</p>
            <p><strong>Technological:</strong> Advancements in hair care technology, manufacturing processes, and digital marketing platforms can facilitate product innovation, distribution, and consumer engagement which P&amp;G should consider when launching Pantene Expert.</p>
            <p><strong>Environmental:</strong> The overall environmental consciousness and sustainability are increasingly important to some extent in Egypt. Pantene Expert should consider eco-friendly packaging and ingredients to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers in the Egyptian market.</p>
